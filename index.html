  <h1>Welcome to Project-404</h1>
  <p>An intense horror experience. Dive into the depths of fear.</p>

  <h2>Dark Origins</h2>
  <p>They called it a signal—buried beneath subspace, impossible to detect. It wasn’t sent. It was waiting. And the moment humanity tuned in, something tuned back.</p>
  <p>Governments collapsed in hours. Not because of war—but because people began to speak in voices not their own. Dreams weren’t dreams anymore. They were warnings.</p>

  <h2>The Descent</h2>
    <p>First came the red sky. Then the weeping static, bleeding from every screen. Survivors carved symbols into concrete with their bare hands, chanting numbers that were never spoken before.</p>
  <p>You are not immune. No one is. But maybe you’re something else now—half-woken, half-severed from whatever calls the dead to walk.</p>
</section>

<section class="content-section">
  <h2>Inside the Madness</h2>
   <p>There are no monsters. Just reflections of us—twisted by grief, molded by regret. Every “enemy” was someone once. And every time you pull the trigger, the static remembers.</p>
  <p>Explore the ruins of a world that tore itself apart without a scream. Piece together lost transmissions. Decode the Signal. Find the Echo Chamber. But do not listen too long…</p>

  <h2>Step Into the Unknown</h2>
    <p>“Project-404” is not a remake. It is an original descent into psychological dread, crafted from scratch. Every corner hides lore, and every shadow is a memory with teeth.</p>
  <p>This is a living nightmare, stitched from forgotten data and broken minds. It’s not about survival. It’s about remembering what we’ve become.</p>
